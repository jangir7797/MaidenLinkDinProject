LinkedIn Post Generator – Powered by AI
Unlock the power of AI to craft engaging LinkedIn posts in seconds!
This project leverages cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate impactful LinkedIn content, either by analyzing a web article (automatic web scraping) or based on custom topics and details you provide. With a single click, generate high-quality posts ready to share with your network.

🚀 Features
LLM-Powered Content: Uses large language models to generate relevant and personalized LinkedIn posts.

Flexible Input:

Paste a URL to a web article and let the script automatically extract key information for your post.

Or, simply provide a topic and supporting details for instant content generation.

One-Click Workflow: User-friendly interface—generate posts quickly with minimal effort.

Configurable: Easily connect to your preferred LLM provider via .env settings.

🛠️ Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/linkedin-post-generator.git
cd linkedin-post-generator

2. Set Up the Environment
Create a .env file in the root directory with your LLM API key and model name:

LLM_API_KEY=your_openai_or_other_key_here
LLM_MODEL=your-chosen-model-name (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo)

3. Install Dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the Application
bash
python app.py
Note: adapt the start command if you use a different main file or framework.

✨ How It Works
Article-to-Post: Paste a web article URL; the script scrapes its content, summarizes it using an LLM, and crafts a LinkedIn post.

Topic-to-Post: Enter a topic and details (e.g., project summary, achievement, announcement), and one click generates a polished LinkedIn post.

Copy & Share: Instantly copy your AI-generated post and share it on LinkedIn.
